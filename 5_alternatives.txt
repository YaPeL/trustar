To make it more readable, it will not allow access to array indexes using square brackets (entities[1]).
I would use dot notation eg: entities.1
Also to improve the exercise I would add logging and pandas to create a dataframe and be able to manipulate the data obtained
Doing the exercise was fun for me. 
I would like to receive some feedback about the code, and how you would improve it. 
Thank you very much
